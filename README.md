## Description
Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The profile will display your team members' names, emails, and IDs. Managers' office numbers, engineers' GitHub usernames, and interns' schools will also be displayed. The generated HTML file and a corresponding stylesheet will be generated in the dist folder after all prompts have been answered.
